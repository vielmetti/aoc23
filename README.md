Advent of Code, 2023

https://adventofcode.com

## Plans

Write code to solve puzzles, mostly in awk.

Write tests to prove that puzzles work, mostly in bats.

## Likely outcomes

I'll become a little more familiar with bats and awk.

I won't make it through the whole month.

## Non-plans

Don't use any AI.
